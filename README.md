# Software development for industrial KUKA robot
This code repository consists of two parts: the ctrl and the sim part. The ctrl folder contains all necessary code files for your controller. The sim folder contains the [VREP](https://www.coppeliarobotics.com/) .ttt file with all necessary implementation for simulation.

# Disclaimer
This is an academic master's course project at Otto von Guericke University, Germany. Without permission, this code should not be used for any kind of personal or industrial work.

# What is done by myself
In this file, I developed inverse kinematics, forward kinematics, and lin movement file. 

# How to build
After running the main.cpp from Visual studio, one GUI will be open from vrep where you have to press apply first then select lin movement and press move robot/run.If you run this code you will see lin movement perfectly working on the KUKA robot. For observing the robot movement please open vrep and from vrep please open the scene file from the sim folder. Open the ctrl folder on Microsoft visual studio or any other C++ ide which supports memory management, otherwise, you can get some build error.


# Software requirement 

Make sure you have installed visual studio and vrep. If you have not installedÂ it yet, please download the software from the given below link and install it first.

* Microsoft visual studio 2019, [Software Download link](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/)

* vrep 3.6.2(Coppelia Robotics), [Software download link](https://www.coppeliarobotics.com/previousVersions)

# How to clone the repository
In the git bash terminal use the following command to close the repository

    $ git clone https://github.com/mghosh014/SDIR.git

# How this code works
Visual studio takes input from vrep GUI and send set of calculated trajectory to vrep for robots movement
